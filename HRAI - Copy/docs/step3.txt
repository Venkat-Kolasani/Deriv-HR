The CEO Approval Brief (Step 3) takes the combined data from the previous two steps to create a persuasive business case.

Here is exactly what is fed into the AI to generate that brief:

1. Data Sources
The component (
ApprovalClient.tsx
) pulls this from localStorage:

From Step 1 (Feedback): The candidate's profile and their AI Scorecard result (e.g., 8.2/10).
From Step 2 (Compensation): The specific Offer Scenario you selected (Conservative, Competitive, or Aggressive).
2. The exact variables used in the AI Prompt:
When you click into Step 3, the AI receives this "Context Pack":

Category	Specific Fields
Candidate Identity	Name, Role, Department, Location, Experience (years)
Interview Result	The overall AI Review Score (e.g., 8.2/10)
Proposed Offer	Base Salary, Signing Bonus, Equity, Total Comp, and Offer Type
Offer Sentiment	The Acceptance Probability and its AI Justification
3. How the AI uses it:
The AI is instructed to act as an "executive communications specialist" and synthesize these raw numbers into a concise 6-section brief:

Candidate Highlight: Why this person?
Interview Assessment: Summary of the interview score.
Compensation Recommendation: Why this specific salary package?
Strategic Value: Impact on the company roadmap.
Risk Assessment: Reference checks or tenure concerns.
Recommendation: "Approve" or "Decline".
In short: It takes the qualitative feedback from Step 1 and the quantitative math from Step 2 to build the final executive narrative for the CEO.
